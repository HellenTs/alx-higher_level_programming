Scope is the first piece that will help us understand the previous example. A variable’s scope is the part of a program where it is available for use.

JavaScript variables are lexically scoped, meaning that we can determine a variable’s scope from where it is declared in the source code. (This is not entirely true: var variables are not lexically scoped, but we will discuss that shortly.)
